Pacecalc is a stupid simple web app for calculating your running pace. I'm using it as a way to learn the ropes of the React/Redux/Webpack ecosystem. It's still in the early stages of development, so please be kind.

## Development

```
$ git clone https://github.com/garrettn/pacecalc.git
$ cd pacecalc
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The dev server will be running at http://localhost:8080.
